Notes (\*):

1. I worked through the first three chapters of SICP as suggested by some sources (including [teachyourselfcs](https://teachyourselfcs.com/))
2. Also I watched [MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/) and [Brian Harveyâ€™s](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL3E89002AA9B9879E?sort=titleSorter) lectures
3. Chapters 4 and 5 were looked-through and exercises were delayed (as for May, 2019)
